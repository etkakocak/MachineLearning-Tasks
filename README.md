# Machine Learning Tasks


## Task 1
### Exersize 1 - k-NN Classification
The file: ``task1main/Microchips.py``  
This code implements a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier for a microchip quality classification problem. It predicts whether a microchip passes or fails based on test results using Euclidean distance to determine the k-nearest neighbors. The implementation includes a custom k-NN class, decision boundary visualization, and predictions for unknown microchips. 

### Exercise 2 - k-NN Regression
The file: ``task1main/Polynomial.py``  
This code implements k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression to model a non-linear polynomial relationship between input and output variables. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and the model predicts values based on the k nearest neighbors' average. The implementation evaluates multiple k values, computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and test data, and selects the optimal k based on performance.


## Task 2
This Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive Machine Learning task with multiple exercises covering various aspects of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, performance comparison of different models, and hands-on implementations of key ML concepts.
